# Algo-Trading-Strategy
In this project, I conducted a cointegration test to identify futures to pair trade. The test results led me to design a signals-based trading algorithm to pair trade Corn Futures and E-Mini S&P 500 Futures. I developed the algorithm to add to my teamâ€™s paper-traded portfolio. I conducted this project as a part of a student organization, Derivatives Group, at UChicago.
